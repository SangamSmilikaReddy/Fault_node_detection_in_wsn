# Fault_node_detection_in_wsn

This project explores the application of reinforcement learning techniques, specifically Q-learning. We used Python programming language along with libraries like pandas, matplotlib, for data handling and visualization, and Gym for reinforcement learning environments. The project aims to develop an efficient fault detection system. The data for training and evaluation is generated using Simulink of MATLAB to simulate realistic WSN scenarios.
